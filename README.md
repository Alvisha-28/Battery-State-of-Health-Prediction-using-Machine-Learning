## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

### 🔹 1. Linear Regression
A simple model that assumes a **linear relationship** between inputs and output.

### 🔹 2. Random Forest Regressor
An **ensemble learning model** that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

### 🔸 MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
Measures the **average prediction error**

### 🔸 R² Score
Indicates how well the model **fits the data**

---

## Results

| Model | MAE | R² Score |
|------|------|---------|
| Linear Regression | 0.0040 | 0.9966 |
| Random Forest | 0.0063 | 0.9914 |

 **Conclusion:**  
Linear Regression performed better for this dataset due to its near-linear behavior.
